    <h2>Overview<br>
    </h2>
    <p> The Daphnet Freezing of Gait Dataset in users with Parkinson's
      disease (hereafter Daphnet Freezing of Gait Dataset) is a dataset
      devised to benchmark automatic methods to recognize gait freeze
      from wearable acceleration sensors placed on legs and hip.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This dataset is the result of a collaboration between the
      Laboratory for Gait and Neurodynamics, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical
      Center, Israel and the Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Zurich,
      Switzerland. <br>
      Recordings were run at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in
      2008. <br>
      The study was approved by the local Human Subjects Review
      Committee, and was performed in accordance with the ethical
      standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.<br>
    </p>
    <p> For more informations see [1] and additional references below.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Recording scenario</h2>
    <p><img style=" width: 360px; height: 269px;" alt="Scenario"
        src="img/sketchOfPaths_landscape.png"><br>
    </p>
    <p>The dataset was recorded in the lab with emphasis on generating
      many freeze events. Users performed there kinds of tasks: straight
      line walking, walking with numerous turns, and finally a more
      realistic activity of daily living (ADL) task, where users went
      into different rooms while fetching coffee, opening doors, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Sensors</h2>
    <p><img style=" width: 360px; height: 480px;" alt="Sensors"
        src="img/device.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p>The dataset comprises 3 wearable wireless acceleration sensors
      (see [10] for sensor details) recording 3D acceleration at 64 Hz.
      The sensors are placed at the ankle (shank), on the thigh just
      above the knee, and on the hip. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains the following files:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">dataset/
          S&lt;ss&gt;R&lt;rr&gt;.txt</span>: dataset of user &lt;ss&gt;
        in recording run &lt;rr&gt;<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    For all practical purposes all runs of one subject should be
    combined in the evaluations. Separate runs were the results of
    recording technicalities and the need for users to make breaks.
    Users 4 and 10 did not show any freeze.<br>
    <br>
    Each file comprises the data in a matrix format, with one line per
    sample, and one column per channel. The channels are as follows:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Time of sample in millisecond</li>
      <li>Ankle (shank) acceleration - horizontal forward acceleration
        [mg]</li>
      <li>Ankle (shank) acceleration - vertical [mg]</li>
      <li>Ankle (shank) acceleration - horizontal lateral [mg]</li>
      <li>Upper leg (thigh) acceleration - horizontal forward
        acceleration [mg]</li>
      <li>Upper leg (thigh) acceleration - vertical [mg]</li>
      <li>Upper leg (thigh) acceleration - horizontal lateral [mg]</li>
      <li>Trunk acceleration - horizontal forward acceleration [mg]</li>
      <li>Trunk acceleration - vertical [mg]</li>
      <li>Trunk acceleration - horizontal lateral [mg]</li>
      <li>Annotations (see Annotations section)<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Annotations<br>
    </h2>
    The meaning of the annotations are as follows:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>0: not part of the experiment. For instance the sensors are
        installed on the user or the user is performing activities
        unrelated to the experimental protocol, such as debriefing<br>
      </li>
      <li>1: experiment, no freeze (can be any of stand, walk, turn)</li>
      <li>2: freeze</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scripts</h2>
    <p>The following Matlab scripts allow to visualize and process the
      data:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">scripts/do_plot</span>:
        loads and display the sensor readings. For instance, from the
        scripts directory: do_plot('../dataset/S01R01.txt');</li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">scripts/do_test</span>:&nbsp;


        can be used to run the freeze detection algorithm described in
        [1]. Note that this is a streamlined version of the scripts used
        in that publication. In particular, the parameters of the
        algorithm (TH.freeze=threshold freeze and TH.power threshold
        power) must be selected or optimized according to the subject,
        and sensor placement/orientation. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Remarks</h2>
    This dataset was used for publications listed in the References
    section. This is a reduced version of the dataset comprising only
    the information used in the published analyses with rewritten,
    streamlined evaluation scripts. Default algorithm parameters are
    provided.<br>
    <br>
    Annotations were done a posteriori by video analysis. However, due
    to the manual process and at times hard to defined boundaries of
    freezes, there may be up to a couple of 100 ms of jitter between the
    onset of annotations and the effective occurrence of an event. <br>
    <br>
    <h2>License</h2>
    Use of this dataset in publications must be acknowledged by
    referencing the following publication [1]. We also appreciate if you
    inform us (droggen@gmail.com) of any publication using this dataset
    for cross-referencing purposes.<br>

    Reference [1] describes the dataset in details. It explain the data
    acquisition protocol, the kind of sensor used and their placement,
    and the nature of the data acquired. It also provides baseline
    results for the automated detection of freezing of gait, against
    which newer methods can be benchmarked. In particular it describes
    detection sensitivity/specificity for 3 sensor placements and 4
    kinds of derived sensor signals, it analyzes detection latency, and
    provides first insight into user specific v.s. user independent
    performance.<br>
